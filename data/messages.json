    "content": "Hi there, I'm writing because I'm extremely frustrated with my recent order #ORD-2024-5678 that I placed on January 10th. First of all, the delivery was supposed to arrive on January 13th but it came 3 days late on January 16th without any notification. When I finally received the package, I discovered that out of the 5 items I ordered, 2 were completely wrong - I ordered a size Medium blue Nike running shirt but received a size Large red Adidas shirt instead, and I ordered black running shorts but got white tennis shorts. The third item, the running shoes, were the correct model but had a manufacturing defect where the left shoe's sole was already separating from the upper part. The fourth item, a water bottle, was damaged with a large crack down the side making it completely unusable. Only the fifth item, a pair of socks, was correct. I've been a loyal customer for over 3 years and have never experienced such poor service. I need immediate assistance to return all the incorrect and damaged items, get refunds processed, and receive the correct items I originally ordered. I also expect some form of compensation for this terrible experience as I needed these items for a marathon I'm training for and now I'm behind on my training schedule. Please prioritize this as I'm considering taking my business elsewhere if this isn't resolved quickly and satisfactorily.",
